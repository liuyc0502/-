## Case 1: Atherosclerosis

**Image ID:** `cv_001`  
**Source File:** `CV016.html`

![Atherosclerosis](cv_001)

### Description

This is mild coronary atherosclerosis. A few scattered yellow lipid plaques are seen on the intimal surface of the opened coronary artery traversing the epicardial surface of a heart. The degree of atherosclerosis here is not significant enough to cause disease, but could be the harbinger of worse atherosclerosis to come.

### Key Features

- **yellow lipid plaques**: A few scattered yellow lipid plaques

---

## Case 2: Advanced Atherosclerosis

**Image ID:** `cv_002`  
**Source File:** `CV017.html`

![Advanced Atherosclerosis](cv_002)

### Description

This shows more advanced atherosclerosis with a large fibrous plaque and areas of calcification . The lumen is significantly narrowed.

### Key Features

- **fibrous plaque**: This shows more advanced atherosclerosis with a large fibrous plaque
- **calcification**: This shows more advanced atherosclerosis with a large fibrous plaque and areas of calcification
