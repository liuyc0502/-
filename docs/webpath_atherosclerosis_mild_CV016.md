## Mild Coronary Atherosclerosis

### WebPath Case Description

**Gross Pathology Findings**

This is mild coronary atherosclerosis. A few scattered **yellow lipid plaques** are seen on the intimal surface of the opened coronary artery traversing the epicardial surface of a heart.

The degree of atherosclerosis here is not significant enough to cause disease, but could be the harbinger of worse atherosclerosis to come.

### Clinical Significance

**Key Features:**
- **Location**: Intimal surface of coronary artery
- **Appearance**: Yellow lipid plaques
- **Distribution**: Scattered, few in number
- **Clinical Impact**: Not clinically significant at this stage
- **Prognosis**: May progress to more severe atherosclerosis

### Pathophysiology Notes

**Early Atherosclerotic Changes:**
1. Lipid accumulation in the arterial intima
2. Formation of fatty streaks (earliest visible lesion)
3. Yellow appearance due to cholesterol and lipid deposits
4. Typically asymptomatic at this stage

**Progression Risk:**
- These early plaques may evolve into fibrous plaques
- Continued lipid deposition can lead to plaque enlargement
- Risk of eventual luminal narrowing and clinical symptoms
- Modifiable risk factors: hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes

### Comparison with Normal Coronary Artery

| Feature | Normal Coronary | Mild Atherosclerosis |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Intimal Surface | Smooth, translucent | Scattered yellow plaques |
| Lumen | Widely patent | Still widely patent |
| Clinical Impact | None | None (yet) |
| Blood Flow | Unimpeded | Minimally affected |
